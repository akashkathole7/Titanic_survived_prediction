Welcome to the Titanic Survived Prediction Project!

In this project, we will use machine learning algorithms to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features. Our goal is to build a system that can accurately predict whether a passenger survived or not based on their age, sex, ticket class, and other features.

Now, let's dive into the details of this project!

Dependencies
To run this project, you will need to install the following dependencies:

Python 3.6 or higher
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Don't worry if you don't have these dependencies installed, we have included a requirements.txt file that you can use to install them automatically.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic Dataset. It contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including their age, sex, ticket class, and whether they survived or not.

Preprocessing
Before we can train our model, we need to preprocess the data. This includes handling missing values and encoding categorical features. We will also perform some feature engineering to create new features that can improve the accuracy of our model.

Training
We will train our model using the scikit-learn library's random forest classifier. This is a powerful algorithm that can handle both categorical and numerical features.

Testing
To evaluate the accuracy of our model, we will use cross-validation and the accuracy metric. We will also generate a confusion matrix and a classification report to better understand the performance of our model.

How to Use
To use this project, you can clone the repository and run the following commands:

css
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
Our program will preprocess the data, train the model, and test its accuracy. You can also modify the hyperparameters of the random forest classifier to see how it affects the accuracy of the model.

Conclusion
With this project, we hope to have a better understanding of how machine learning algorithms can be used to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. We encourage you to try out different machine learning algorithms or even explore different datasets to see what you can achieve!

Happy predicting and remember, we won't let go, ! ðŸ˜‰
